### PWM_Generation

---

This project about PWM generation using **STM32F103C8** microcontroller using timer. In this I have used GPIO & GPT functions which I have implemented in the drivers.
All things have done at register level you can find all the files in the repository. You can find the Circuit-Diagram below which is used in this project.

**`Circuit :-`**




There is output video also available you can see the output in that.
